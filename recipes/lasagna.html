            Method:
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Cook the Lasagna Noodles
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring
                    occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turn the oven on and preheat to 190 degrees C (375 degrees F).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Prepare the sauce
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted
                    margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring
                    constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese
                    into sauce until smooth.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Prepare the filling
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Whisk ricotta cheese, egg and egg white together in a bowl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heat olive oil in a medium size frying pan over medium-high heat; saute carrots, courgette and
                    spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Bring it all together
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a
                    9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer
                    of mozzarella cheese.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
